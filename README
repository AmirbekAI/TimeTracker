📘 About This Project
Recently, I felt like I wasn’t working as much as I could—and I wanted to change that. But as the saying goes:

"You can’t improve what you don’t measure."

So I set out to find a way to track my work hours and get a visual overview of my productivity.

Building a full-fledged app would take too long, and existing tools were either overkill or too expensive. That’s why I created this simple, effective time-tracking tool.

⚙️ How It Works
You can create keyboard shortcuts (explained in the create_shortcuts.md file).

When you start working, just hit your shortcut to begin tracking.

Press your stop shortcut when you're done.

The time data gets saved and automatically added to your Google Calendar.

At the end of the day, you'll be able to visually see how much you've worked—right in your calendar.

✨ Why I Love It
It’s lightweight, fast, and super effective.
Give it a try and let me know how it works for you.
Enjoy! 😄
